
This project focuses on developing an energy prediction/forecasting model for energy prosumers to reduce energy imbalance costs. Energy prosumers are individuals, businesses, or organizations that both produce and consume energy. Unlike the traditional model where consumers purchase energy from utilities and rely on centralized power generation sources, energy prosumers generate their own electricity, typically through renewable energy sources like solar panels, wind turbines, or small-scale hydropower systems. They also consume energy from the grid when their own generation is insufficient to meet their needs.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

1. **Reduce Energy Imbalance Costs**: By accurately predicting the energy production and consumption of prosumers, we aim to minimize the costs associated with energy imbalances.
2. **Improve Grid Reliability**: Enhance the stability and reliability of the grid by reducing the unpredictability introduced by prosumers.
3. **Optimize Energy Resource Utilization**: Ensure more efficient use of energy resources through better forecasting.
4. **Promote Renewable Energy**: Incentivize more consumers to become prosumers, thus encouraging the production and use of renewable energy.

## Benefits

- **Cost Savings**: Lower operational costs associated with energy imbalances.
- **Grid Stability**: Enhanced grid stability and reliability.
- **Sustainability**: More efficient integration of renewable energy sources into the energy system.
- **Increased Prosumption**: Greater adoption of prosumer roles, leading to more widespread use of renewable energy.
